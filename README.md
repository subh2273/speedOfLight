I have a great fascination towards space and for long I really wanted to implement this idea . Finally after a lot of research work, i wrote some code which shows simple visualization showing the time and distance of light traveling in outer space.

**Steps by step glossary of the notebook:**

1. **Creating the dataframe as this dataframe is nowhere available**
2. **Basic Visualisation**
3. **Enhance the visualisation with the help of Plotly, a python graphic library.**


Below is the he distance and time that sunlight travels to the different Planets.
